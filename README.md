============

I made this just to add a caching layer so that calls to the external api would be less and as a proof of concept for separating the back and front end.  

This application running purely via the external API hosted by OMDB runs on [http://trshant.neocities.org/movies.html](http://trshant.neocities.org/movies.html).

Enjoy!
